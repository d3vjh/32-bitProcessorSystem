# 32-bit Processor System
## Overview
This project involves the design and development of a monolithic application using an object-oriented programming language of your choice (e.g., `Java`, `Python`, `JS`, `C#`, `C++`, `PHP`). The system is based on the following specifications:

* 32-it Processor
* RAM Size: 16 MiB
The processor of this machine is expected to:

* Have 32 banks of registers, each serving a specific function.
* Implement an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) with a 7-bit OPCODE, comprising a minimum of 20 instructions.
* Use fixed-size instructions (32 bits).
* Perform operations exclusively on registers. Memory access is limited to fetching or storing data.
* Additionally, the system should provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize its internal operations, allowing users to interact with the 32-bit processor.
